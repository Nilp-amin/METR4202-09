This file contains the code library for a scara robot. This scara robot uses four Dynamixel AX-12A for the joints, with one of them used for the prismatic joint, and one SG90 servo for the gripping function at the end effector.

This code library contains all the required files: python scripts in each of the robot function packages, the launch files, ximea camera sub modules, fiducial sub modules, dynamixel interface sub modules, and the gazebo simulation files such as urdf files. The python scripts will have doc strings and comments on what each function does and what certain blocks of code do.
